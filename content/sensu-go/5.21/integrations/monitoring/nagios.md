Sensu believes the Nagios service check specification is underappreciated, which is why we made it support for Nagios service checks part of our very first commit.
Whether you have ten or ten thousand existing Nagios checks, Sensu is 100% backwards compatible.

Nagios is an open source monitoring tool for monitoring systems and networks.
