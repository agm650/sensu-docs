Use the [Sensu Slack Handler asset][1] to send Sensu event data to a specific Slack channel and stay up-to-date on your infrastructure within the same tool youâ€™re already using for team collaboration.

## Requirements

To use the [Sensu Slack Handler asset][1] to route alerts to a Slack channel, you must have:

- An existing Sensu installation with at least one check running
- A Slack workspace where you have administrator access to create a webhook

## Examples

Follow [Send Slack alerts with handlers][2] to send alerts to Slack in the channel #monitoring by configuring a handler named `slack` to a check named `check-cpu`.
