Puppet is a configuration management tool that relies on a declarative approach.
Like many configuration management platforms, Puppet software helps you reduce manual errors and treat your infrastructure as code.
The most recent release of the Sensu module closely aligns Puppet module parameters with Sensu Go data types, which makes operating Sensu a more streamlined experience.

The [Sensu Puppet module][1] is available in the [Sensu-Puppet GitHub repo][2].

Sensu partnered with [Tailored Automation][3] to enhance the Puppet module with new features and bug fixes.
Learn more about [v4 of the Sensu Puppet module][4].
