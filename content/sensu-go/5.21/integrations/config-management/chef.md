Chef is a configuration management tool written in Ruby and Erlang.
With Chef, you use prewritten code known as “recipes” to define your infrastructure, security policies, and system dependencies.
Chef helps you maintain consistency and repeatability with your system, automating previously manual work so operators can focus on new projects.

The Chef cookbook for Sensu is available in the [Sensu-Go-Chef GitHub repo][1].
